Problem:1

Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take an integer array of size
N as input and show output in reverse order.

Sample Input: 
5
5 10 3 20 1
Sample Output:
1 20 3 10 5

problem:2

You will be given an positive integer N and after that an integer array of size N. Then you will be given Q which
refers to queries. For each query you will be given i and v where i refers to the index and v to value. You need to
add the value to that index. After all of the queries print the values

Sample Input: 
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
0 10
2 5
4 5
Sample Output:
11 2 8 4 10
